# *Data Engineering Roadmap & Complete Notes*

🔥 This repo represents my personal learning path for Data Engineering covering everything from **SQL & Databases** to **Big Data frameworks (Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Kafka)** and **Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, Databricks, Google Cloud Dataproc)**.

**For A beginer I highly recomend Start with the followings**
1.  [SQL Full Course for Beginners (30 Hours)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSKVgrwhzus)
2.  [bigdata engineering bootcamp with gcp and azure cloud](https://www.udemy.com/course/big-data-engineering-bootcamp-with-gcp-and-azure-cloud)

 For me it all took  **4–6 hours daily for about 3 months** 

✅ Master ETL Pipelines, Big Data, and Distributed Systems \n
✅ Understand Data Warehousing, Data Lakes, and Cloud Data Engineering \n
✅ Learn Apache Spark, Kafka, Hive, Hadoop, PySpark** in depth\n
✅ Build real-world scalable data engineering projects\n

🔥 **Above 1 & 2 Will cover the below**
